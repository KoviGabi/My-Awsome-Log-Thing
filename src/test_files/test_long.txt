This thesis was very challenging, but also fun. After this thesis I am thinking about getting a job in this area.
I really like web based programming a lot now. I will read and learn a lot about web programming, node.js and 
frameworks like nw.js, because this area is awsome!
I can thank's a lot to my supervisor, Laborci Gergely. He came up with the idea of this task/thesis.
He gave me a lot with this great idea of his. If I become a web developer it will be because of him.

Wow it's hard to write this much about almost nothing.
I hope reading this easter egg makes you smile a bit whoever you are :)
And congrats for finding this writing of mine :D
